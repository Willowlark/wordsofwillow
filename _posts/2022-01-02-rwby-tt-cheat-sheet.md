# Mechanics

## Skill Checks

- All skill checks begin on `2d10`. 
- These first two d10 are special.
	- When both are 10, you get a natural 20. Natural 20's automatically succeed.
	- When both are 1, you get a natural 2. Natural 2's automatically fail.

## Rule of Cool

- Rule of Cool is shared by the whole party. 
- Rule of Cool is awarded after you succeed at something cool. Some inspiration:
	- Two characters working in tandem. 
	- Clever role-play.
	- Using enemies against each other. 
	- Lateral thinking. 
	- Three-dimensional movement.
	- Doing things according to character desires even if they complicate things for the player.
â€¢ Making a particularly cringe-worthy pun or one liner.
- Rule of Cool is added to all **Skill Checks** (This includes Accuracy) and **Damage Rolls**. 
- When you roll a natural 20, automatically get a Rule of Cool and apply it to that roll.
- When you roll a natural 2, lose a Rule of Cool.

# Combat
1. Roll Initiative, take the highest from the allies, if higher than highest enemy `Speed` stat, Allies act first. 
	- `WIL+PER` When attacking firest
	- `AGI+PER` When engaged by someone else
2. Allies and Enemies act as a group on their turn, each gets three actions that can be taken in any order. **Up to Two Actions** can be Major. 
	1. Allies
		- **Major Actions**
			1. Attack an enemy (See [Attacks](#attacks) table) 
				- Optionally, Capacity Boost (Spend 1 Capcity, +1 Accuracy)
				- If Accuracy roll 5 or more greater than threshold, apply [Defense Thresholds](#defense-thresholds).
				- If Accuracy roll of Attack > Target's Defense Threshold, Deal Damage.
			2. Use Semblance (Non combat use) 
				- Semblance Infusion (Spend 2 Cap to add Element dust effect)
			3. Reload (Restore **DIS+1** Capacity)
			4. **Two Actions** Charge Attack (Attack, spend 1-3 Capacity, add Capacity spent to Accuracy and Damage)
		- **Minor Actions**
			1. Move 1 range increment closer/further from someone
			2. Make a Skill check
				- Capacity Boost (Spend 1 Capcity, +1 to Skill Check)
			3. Grapple target
				- `STR+PER` versus target's `Speed`. On a Success with RoC:
				- Equal to target's Threat: Target held in place
				- Less than target's Threat: Move with Target when it moves
				- Greater than target's Threat: Allows you to - 
					- Move Target with you as major action
					- Throw with `STR+END` versus Defense Threshold.
	2. Enemies
		1. Move 1 range increment closer/further from someone
		2. Make an Attack
			1. Target choses a Defense Roll (see [Defending](#defending))
			2. If roll < than attackers `Attack` Attribute, deal Damage listed in block.
		3. Use a special ability on stat block

# Attack Resolution

## Attacks

| Attack              | Accuracy                 | Range       | Damage  | Capacity | Special       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------- |:--------:| ------------- |
| Melee Weapon        | Melee Weapon Style       | Adjacent    | 1d6+STR |          |               |
| Ranged Weapon       | Ranged Weapon Style      | Long Range  | 1d6     |    -1    |               |
| Thrown Melee Weapon | Melee Weapon Style       | Close Range | 1d6     |          | Lose Weapon   |
| Semblance           | `WIL+Relevant Attribute` | Close       | WIL     |          | Requires Aura |
| Unarmed             | `STR+END`                | Adjacent    | STR     |          |               |
| Dust Phial          | `DIS + Color Dependent`  | Close       | DIS     |    -2    |               |

### Defense Thresholds

When an Accuracy Roll is a certain amount higher than the Defense Threshold of the Target being attacked, the attack gains additional effects. The following list shows the effects under how many points are required to achieve them. Chose one from each tier that applies. IE, if the accuracy roll is 15 over, chose a +5, +10, and +15.

Optionally, you can take a lower tier bonus instead of a higher tier (a +5 rather than a +10).

- **5 Points Over**
	- Critical Damage (Can select multiple times, add damage listed in Stat Block)
	- Stagger Target
	- Confuse Target
- **10 Points Over**
	- Maximize Damage (All d6s rolled for Damage are 6s)
	- Cripple Target
	- Collateral Damage (Any enemy with equal or less Defense that's adjacent to the Target takes all Damage and Effects from this attack as well.)
- **15 Points Over** 
	- Cleave Target
	- Stun Target
- **20 Points Over**
	- Dispatch Target (Reduce Target's health to 0.)
