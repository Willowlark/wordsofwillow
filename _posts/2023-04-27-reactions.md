# Reactions


Reactions is a term for actions a Pokemon can take when it's being attacked by another Pokemon. There are a number of different types. There is no homebrew content in this document, just the rules as written restructured. The following are keywords that are relevant to the moves listed below, and Reaction is a new one.

- **Reaction** This move can be used on another Pokemon's turn. Reactions do NOT take up your Pokemon's action on their turn during this rotation! *Ex: You can use Protect on your opponent's turn, then use Fire Blast on yours.*
- **Shield Move** If the Pokemon performs another Shield Move during the next Round, that Moveâ€™s Accuracy Roll is reduced by 2 successes. For more info, see p.54. *The aspect of using a Shield Move on another Pokemon's turn is taken care of by Reaction.*
- **Priority X** The Move ignores Initiative Order and acts right away. More info on p. 53. *Priority is almost the same as a Reaction. However, Reactions are faster than any Priority number and Priority uses your action for the current initiative rotation.*
- **Low Priority X** When this move is used, the User takes the attack as normal from the Attacker, then immediately performs the Low Priority move. The Target of the Low Priority move cannot React to it.

The steps in a turn are as follows.

1. Attacker declares an Attack
2. Target may call for a reaction 
3. Roll Accuracy *The Attacker is locked into the move they rolled for!*
4. Target may call for a reaction, if they hadn't before.
5. Target rolls reaction if one was called for
6. Roll Damage if the reaction failed.
