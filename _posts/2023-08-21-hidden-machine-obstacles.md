# HMs for a Narrative Game

![Pasted image 20230821151337.png](Pasted image 20230821151337.png){: w="100" .right}

Hidden Machines in the games were specific moves that allowed you to move or interact with the overworld in specific ways. While HMs have gone by the wayside in the modern games, the concept of Pokemon enabling new shortcuts, avoiding obstacles, and being required to pass barriers is a great idea to spice up a Pokerole journey. 

This is a list of various action words a Pokemon could take, and types of Pokemon that might be able to take that. Use these action words to inspire obstacles or challenges in your party's path as they journey through the Pokemon world. *The Types columns are only suggestions!* If it makes sense a Pokemon can take that action in the given situation, allow it! 

> Moves
> This table is just based off of types or Pokemon and then generic powers that type might have. Moves are another great source of inspiration! Build backwards, look at a player's move and build a puzzle or obstacle that just asks to be solved using that move.
