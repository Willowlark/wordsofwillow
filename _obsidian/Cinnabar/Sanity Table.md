Each of these **Events** triggers a `Will` roll. Use the trainers current Will Points for this roll, not max Will. The number of successes required is listed in the **DC** column, and the trainer loses the number of will points listed in the **Failure** column when the fail, **Success** column when they succeed.

When using the Sanity Table, a trainer who loses all their Will Points blacks out and enters a coma. They will not recover without extensive medical care. A player who is at half Will suffers a Breakdown. In combat, a breakdown will manifest as either Fight or Flight, for better or worse. Out of combat, roleplay the breakdown. These are serious breaks and at best can be bottled up, not resolved in a session.
