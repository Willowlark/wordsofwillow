### [Frontier#Manectric Meadows]({% link _obsidian/UnovaWildWest/Frontier.md %})

> Speaking of the tall grass, the wind is blowing, and the grass is rustling over there...

`Dexterity+Alert` will allow the players to realize there's a pair of ("blue dog like creatures with a pointed mane on their head") Manectric stalking them in the nearby tall grass. The Manectric continue to trail them if they don't stop walking. *They're waiting for the PCs to stop and camp*.

> - `Tough+Intimidatex2` - Scare the Manectric off
> - `Dexterity+Stealthx3` - Lose the Manectric in the tall grass.
