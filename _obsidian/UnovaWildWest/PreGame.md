[Western Name Generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/cowboy-names.php)

Your character has answered a request for aid out in the Wild West. Said request read:

> Help Request in Littlebank Town STOP
> Wild pkmn attacking Town STOP
> Looking for Pkmn trainers to drive them off STOP
> Contact Mayor Sherman Sheppard Upon arrival STOP
> Cash Reward STOP 

Your character is to be built with the following guidelines:

- Amateur Rank
- Up to Two Pokemon
    - Both should be found at or under Amateur rank in the Pokerole Pokedex
    - Both Amateur rank
    - One may be in a second tier evolution, the other must be a first tier
    - No regional restrictions
- To fit the wild west theme, take two zeros off the end of every price listed (Basically, yen to dollar). 
    - Start with 30 dollars

The following homebrew rules will also be in place, to emulate the Legends style.

- You cannot release more than one Pokemon into battle at a time (it's considered too risky at this time and considered Taboo)
- Trainers are considered to be in the fray automatically and cannot be considered out of the fray
- Pokemon will often continue to target a trainer even after a pokemon has been released, at least until the trainer's pokemon has dealt some damage. A successful Dexterity+Throw roll to hit a wild pokemon directly with a pokeball will draw it's attention to the released pokemon, giving you some breathing room.
