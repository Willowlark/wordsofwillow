## Sheriff's Office

> The front room services as Office for the Sheriff and presumably a deputy while the backroom has three jail cells built into it. The office is pretty messy, though the weapons are at least locked up. 

- **Sheriff Harvey Holder** - A late teens kid who doesn't fill out the Sheriff's outfit at all. He was the deputy until recently when the actual Sheriff got injured by Lycanroc and had to go back to the big city for treatment. 

## Saloon

- **Roxie Kent** - A boisterous badass of a woman who runs the bar. She's married to the bar's legal owner Andy Kent who went missing a week back. She's always been the one in charge though, of their relationship and the bar.

## Town Hall

> The office has a surprising amount of finery for a town this far out west. There are vases on displays, paintings on the wall, framed documents and the wood looks treated. There's a large desk opposite the front door that appears to be a reception area. A few simple chairs dot the main room, and two doors lead further into the office, one to both the left and right of the receptionist. Both doors are closed. The one on the left has a gold placard that says "Mayor" on it. 

- [Sophia Walter]({% link _obsidian/UnovaWildWest/Sophia Walter.md %}) is usually behind the receptionist desk. 
- [Wilson Downs]({% link _obsidian/UnovaWildWest/Wilson Downs.md %}) owns the office on the right, but is rarely there.

### The Mayor's Office

> The Mayor's office is decorated much like main room. Rather than generic paintings however, there are various photographs of the Mayor himself. Many picture him with trains while others having him shaking hands with other politicians. Bookshelves sit on the back wall and there's a window on the wall to the left as you enter. The main piece of furniture in the room is a massive wooden desk in the center of the room. It's neatly organized with papers and pens and behind it sits the Mayor himself, [Sherman Sheppard]({% link _obsidian/UnovaWildWest/Sherman Sheppard.md %}). 

- [Sherman Sheppard]({% link _obsidian/UnovaWildWest/Sherman Sheppard.md %}) is usually in his Office

## Train Station

> The train station is non descript, simply a place for people to disembark safely. A few wooden benches dot the room but are otherwise there's nothing to say about it.

- **Theodore Nolan** - A mid 40's man who manages the train station. He has a massive bushy mustache his face can't be seen under and is a kind, if curious man. 

## Bank

- **Raymond Pitts** - A dower man who runs the bank. He's more interested in the accounting than people and has a habit of assuming anyone new to the bank is here to rob it. *He survived a bank robber a few years back*

## General Store

- **Augusta Herman** - A widow who runs the general store. Good friends with **Roxie Kent**. Lady like, but get on her bad side and she's as cold as ice. 

## Post Office

- **Bertie Stark** - an older woman and the only person in town who owns a Pokemon. She and her pelepper moved out here with her late husband years and years ago and just stayed to keep delivering mail. She bullies anyone who bullies pelepper.
