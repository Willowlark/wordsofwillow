# Avalon Ultima World

1. **Avalon is a place much like ours.** Avalon has very similar technology, though how it's been developed over the centuries may differ depending on the tech. TV networks, radio communications, firearms, and even some futuristic things like mecha and mad science can be found, though for the appropriate price. Notably, while computers exist there is no infrastructure for the Internet to exist, and mobile communications are limited to basics like radio due to prohibitive cost. Avalon also has Magic, an ancient art that can produce effects that the laws of nature cannot explain. Avalon has a number of key settlements but is otherwise limited in infrastructure: the wilderness between cities is fraught with danger from monsters and hazards. Avalon is currently at peace, but the last great war was within recent memory for some as is the damage dealt by it. Avalon has had civilizations prior to ours as well, remnants of it can be found in ruins around the world with some of their powerful technology still functioning. 
2. **The Millennium Corporation has their hands in every business, governments, and service.** The Millennium Corporation is the creator of Generative Pre-Trained Tomes, a technology that innovated the way of life in Avalon. This technology has revolutionized nearly every industry, which has given The Millennium Corporation leverage over all of them due to the reliance. Be it public, private, indirect. or direct, The Millennium Corporation has some form of influence in most organizations. The Millennium Corporation has incredibly high public opinion, as their products have changed the quality of life of everyone in the Avalon. Most towns and cities in Avalon are now reliant on Millennium Corporation technology in one way or another.
3. **Millennium Corporation is run by Eon Dusk, a billionaire inventor and businessman.** Eon Dusk is the original creator of Generative Pre-Trained Tomes and much beloved by everyone in the world due to the invention. He runs The Millennium Corporation while still innovating, he has a known interest in Robotics and Cybernetics which he pushes his company to develop. He's extremely vocal on his opinions and frequently pushes them on governments using his considerable influence. Most people consider him an altruistic inventor who has done incredible things for their quality of life. Those that work with him and his supporters consider him a visionary who will shape the world for generations to come, never questioning his decisions.
4. **Generative Pre-Trained Tomes (GPTs) are small artificial gems that provide the power and ability to use magic to anyone who holds them, or devices designed to harness them.** Avalon has been running out of resources for a long time now, it was the cause of the last great war. Eon Dusk's invention of GPTs a decade ago has solved the energy and resource crisis seemingly overnight. GPTs power weapons, street lamps, computers, cars, water filters, anything you can imagine. GPTs are in massive demand by governments and people, which keeps The Millennium Corporation very, very rich. GPTs can't be created fast enough despite The Millennium Corporation having multiple farms dedicated to their production. 
5. **True Magic is a dying art form due to the exploding popularity of GPTs.** Much like letter writing died out to instant messaging in this world, the practice of using Magic the "hard" way has completely fallen out of favor. While anyone can learn True Magic, it takes years of practice and hard work to master spells one can now do in an instant with a GPT bought off the shelf. Vocal groups now push that True Magic is more dangerous than GPTs and for public safety, people should rely on GPTs instead. True Magic practitioners would argue this, but they are far and few in between and don't do well in the courts that are controlled by The Millennium Corporation behind the scenes anyway. 
6. **GPT Farms are massive plants that produce GPTs for The Millennium Corporation which are spread out across Avalon.** While the machinery in these plants is maintained by the main office of The Millennium Corporation, these farms employee thousands of people in Avalon, another PR win for The Millennium Corporation. These plants are massive and mysterious, as very few truly understand all the steps involved in the creation of GPTs (a closely guarded secret by Eon Dusk). Despite the HQ of The Millennium Corporation being in Solar, a city build by Eon Dusk himself, the five current GPT farms are spread out among the major cities of Avalon. In fact, Salazar lobbied for the latest reactor to be built in their town as they were struggling prior. 
7. **The world is supported by the Spiritual Fabric, made up of the Aether of every living thing that has come before us.** While the existence of the Spiritual Fabric is widely believed, it's not a scientifically proved fact. Traditional belief is that Magic can exist despite breaking the laws of nature because our ancestors have worked into to the Fabric as a gift to protect us. While this is the most popular belief, another common one is that of the 5 Major Arcanum and the Minor Arcanum, powerful spirits and creatures that represent the elements and are guardians of the Fabric.
8. **Notable Historical Events include**
    1. **The Ancient's War**: Something caused the last civilization of Avalon to be wiped out and leave behind only ruins. What that was is lost to time. 
    2. **The Great War**: fought over dwindling natural resources. 40+ years ago. Ended when the kingdoms were spending more resources to fight than survive internally and the damage to each kingdom was enough that they weren't in desperate need of additional resources.
    3. **Invention of GPTs**: 20 years back from current date. Revolutionized the world's resources problems and became a wide spread success, making the Millennium Corporation a household name.
    4. **Hurricane Jabari**: A massive hurricane that flooded and nearly destroyed Cymur 7 years ago. The Millennium Corporation assisted with the recovery in exchange for building a GPT Farm there.

# Joining the Game

The party will be characters who have attracted the ire of the Millennium Corporation and their allies. They'll adventure to stay one step ahead of the all powerful Corp, but also to see about unraveling the damage they're doing the public is blind to. 

- Character will:
    - be level 5, and may use any classes from Bonus, High, Techno, or Natural Fantasy content. At character creation, I suggest no more than one non core class at character creation however. 
    - using Custom Weapons and Hoplospheres. (While Memnosphere fit the setting, the complexity of doing them on a VTT is a bit of a turn off and your characters are (probably) not GPT types) 
    - Quirks and Heroic Skills can be requested during session 0
    - Zero Powers tbd (I'd like to use the linked powers rule)
    - I'm going to homebrew Bonds a bit, detailed here: https://wiki.aurii.us/doku.php?id=obsidian:brewery:golden_sky_bonds

**Session 0** will expand on the party's group dynamic and prologue, as well as fill in additional details of the world. While the Millennium Corporation is the primary force in this world, there are plenty of other enemies and allies to be created to flesh out the rest of this map and world. *Please don't bring your completed character to session 0!* You want to have flexibility to align your history and events with your allies. 

### Session Zero Questions

- Millennium Corp is well received across the world, but you've experienced something that made you form your own opinion. What was it? Who was involved? What action does it drive you to take? 
- What's hurt you in the past? Who was behind it? Are you still suffering the consequences of what happened, or is it an old wound?

### BROUGHT TOGETHER BY FATE

You find yourselves working together because of the circumstances. Despite this being
a common trope in classic fantasy tales, it is actually the most difficult to pull off since
your group will lack a precise goal: you must work with each other during play to build
a web of relationships (Bonds become incredibly important).

If you choose this premise, it may be a good idea to switch to a different type of group
once your characters have developed a common goal.

- What emotional or familial connections exist between your characters?
- Have your characters met in the past? Are there any tensions or rivalries?
- What do you have in common? Beliefs, enemies, past experiences?

### GUARDIANS

One of the Player Characters is a Chosen One, a person tasked with a mission that
could change the very fate of the world. Everyone else in your group has sworn, by duty
or by choice, to protect the Chosen One during their travels.

- What bonds, ties or rivalries exist between each guardian and the Chosen One?
- What is your mission? Who gave it to you? Do the authorities approve of it?
- Why does the Chosen One need protection? Who or what threatens their mission?

### HEROES OF THE RESISTANCE

You are the last line of defense against a terrible power, a darkness that threatens to
envelop the known world — such as a power-hungry kingdom or an oppressive empire.
The fate of many lies within your hands.

- Why is this daunting task up to you? Have you fought against this enemy before?
- Which factions helped you, and which ones betrayed or opposed you?
- Who are the most infamous among the enemy leaders and followers?

### REVOLUTIONARIES

You form a small force that fights tooth and nail against a dominant power: it might be
a tyrannical government, a military occupation, or even a ruthless industrial company.
Society and security forces probably consider you criminals or terrorists.
 
- What is the price your character paid for their insubordination?
- Which factions promised you their help? Which factions might oppose you?
- What are your enemies’ crimes, and why is no one else opposing them?

### SEEKERS
You are desperately searching for someone or something — a powerful witch, an
ancient relic, a legendary location, or even a long-lost technological marvel. What you
seek is the world’s last hope, or at least, you think it is.
- What is it you are trying to prevent or remedy? What are you looking for?
- What do you know of your mission? Who or what gave you this information?
- Who doesn't want you to find what you seek?
- What prompted each of you to join this mission?
