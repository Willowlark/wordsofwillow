**Early Bird** The time this Pokémon would be asleep is reduced by half, it will only need to score 2 successes on its Insight roll to wake up in battle. This effect does not apply for the move “Rest”
Pokémon with this ability are light sleepers that will easily rise from slumber. They wake up full of energy with just a couple hours of sleep.

**Flash Fire** The first time this Pokémon is hit by a Fire-Type move, add 1 Extra Die to the Damage Pool of Fire-type Moves this Pokémon uses until the end of the scene. Fire-type moves do not deal damage to this Pokémon.
This Pokémon is capable of consuming other fire sources and adding them to its own. Walking through embers, fire, lava and hell feel like a breeze to it.
