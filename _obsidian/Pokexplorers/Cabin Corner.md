#pokexplorers/locations

> A clearing nestled into the woods with a single path that leads back to the rest of the camp. One cabin faces the rest which sit in a semi circle along the clearing border. That cabin is the counselor's cabin, while the remainder are available for the campers.
> Each cabin feels like a log cabin, but has modern amenities worked in. Each camper in the cabin has their own dresser and bed to use, and there are multiple pokemon beds that can be put out. 

The following map was created by *@swordsmandrake* on the Pokerole Discord!
