# CREATE A CHARACTER

| **Chose a Style** |            |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Straight-Laced    | Noble      |
| Flirt             | Lazy       |
| Cinnamon Roll     | Mysterious |
| Pious             | Clever     | 


| **Chose a Class** | -                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Swordsman          | Soldier (Lances) |
| Brigand (Axe)      | Archer           |
| Pegasus Knight     | Mage             |
| Armored Knight     | Laguz/Manakete   |

## Choose a Number

Choose your number, from **2 to 5**. A high number means  you’re  better  at LANCES *(technology;  science; cold rationality; calm, precise action)*. A low number means you’re better at LORDS *(intuition; diplomacy; seduction; wild, passionate action)*.

## Give yourself a Name

Give yourself a cool name, like "Ephriwood Von Ordelgan" or "Ike".

Choose what kingdom you hail from: *Faerghus* (Traditional, cold, pious), *Adrestia* (Empire, large, revolutionary) or *Leicester* (Alliance, subtle, divided).

## You Have:

You have the weapon type your class uses, an academy uniform, a vulnerary, a horse if you want one, and 5,000 Gold. 

## Choose a Character Goal: 

| **Chose a Goal**          | -                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Marry into Wealth         | Prove yourself to your Family |
| Serve your Kingdom        | Change the World              |
| Research forbidden Magics | Become the Strongest          | 

# ROLLING THE DICE

When you do something risky, roll **1d6** to find out how it goes. Roll **+1d** if you’re prepared and **+1d** if you’re an expert. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.) Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number. If you’re using LANCES (science, reason), you want to roll under your number. If you’re using LORDS, (rapport, passion) you want to roll over your number.

> Class Bonus
> 
> Each Class trains a with specific type of weapon and is particularly effective against another class's weapon type. Whenever you fight someone with a class you're strong against, add **+1d** to your rolls.
> 
> | Class          | Strong Against |
> | -------------- | -------------- |
> | Brigand        | Soldier        |
> | Soldier        | Swordsman      |
> | Swordsman      | Brigand        |
> | Archer         | Pegasus Knight |
> | Pegasus Knight | Mage           |
> | Mage           | Armored Knight |
> | Armored Knight | Archer         |
> | Laguz/Manakete | N/a            |
> 
{: .prompt-tip }
- **0** If none of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.
- **1** If  one  die  succeeds,  you  barely  manage  it.  The  GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.
- **2** If two dice succeed, you do it well. Good job!
- **3** If three dice succeed, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get. 

If you roll your number exactly, you have *LANCE LORD*.  You  get  a  special  insight  into  what’s  going on. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Some good questions: *(A roll of LANCE LORD counts as a success.)*

> What are they really feeling? 
> Who’s behind this? How could I get them to _____? What should I be on  the  lookout  for?
> What’s  the  best  way  to  _____?  What’s really going on here?

**HELPING:**  If  you  want  to  help  someone  else  who’s  rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them +1d.

Play to find out how they defeat the threat. Introduce the threat by showing evidence of its recent badness. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it’s about to happen, then ask them what they do. “Ironwood charges the mega-cannons  on  his  ship.  What  do  you  do?”  “Roman  pours  you  a  glass  of  Arcturan  whiskey and slips her arm around your waist. What do you do?”

Call  for  a  roll  when  the  situation  is  uncertain.  Don’t  pre-plan  outcomes—let  the  chips fall where they may. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill
