## Give yourself a Name and Race

Give yourself a cool name with a color reference and decide if you're a Faunus or a Human.

## You Have:

You have a cool weapon that's also a gun, a scroll communication device, and a unique outfit.

## Choose a Character Goal:

# ROLLING THE DICE

When you do something risky, roll **1d6** to find out how it goes. Roll **+1d** if you’re prepared and **+1d** if you’re an expert. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.) Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.If you’re using GUN (science, reason), you want to roll under your number.If you’re using AURA, (rapport, passion) you want to roll over your number.

- **0** If none of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.
- **1** If  one  die  succeeds,  you  barely  manage  it.  The  GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.
- **2** If two dice succeed, you do it well. Good job!
- **3** If three dice succeed, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get. 

If you roll your number exactly, you have *GUN AURA*.  You  get  a  special  insight  into  what’s  going on. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Some good questions: *(A roll of GUN AURA counts as a success.)*

> What are they really feeling? 
> Who’s behind this? How could I get them to _____? What should I be on  the  lookout  for?  
> What’s  the  best  way  to  _____?  What’s really going on here? 

**HELPING:**  If  you  want  to  help  someone  else  who’s  rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them +1d.

Play to find out how they defeat the threat. Introduce the threat by showing evidence of its recent badness. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it’s about to happen, then ask them what they do. “Ironwood charges the mega-cannons  on  his  ship.  What  do  you  do?”  “Roman  pours  you  a  glass  of  Arcturan  whiskey and slips his arm around your waist. What do you do?”

Call  for  a  roll  when  the  situation  is  uncertain.  Don’t  pre-plan  outcomes—let  the  chips fall where they may. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill
