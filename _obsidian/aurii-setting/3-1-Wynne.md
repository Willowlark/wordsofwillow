Wynne is a country on the northern island of *Gawic*. All of Gawic is a tundra climate, populated with dense forests and snowy mountains. There are only two true settlements that make up the country, along with the sacred home of the *Naissankari* and a mountain outpost the the Pegasus Knights call home. 

Wynne came to be back at the start of the Age of Humanity when the remaining humans became divide on Lyarlel and Lylalel. The majority of people praised Lylalel for saving them and those who felt Lyarlel had a point, that humanity must respect the natural world more, left the mainland to settle on Gawic. This part of Wynnite history has been lost to time however, and the modern culture now has a religious focus on their ancestors and the spirits of the land rather than the dragon god. 

Naissankari live among the Wynnites as full members of Wynnite society. Many however choose to live in Roren, the ancestral home of the Naissankari deep in the northern woods. Roren does not allow human residents, though it's not unheard of for humans to visit. Some areas of Roren have never been seen by human eyes however. Roren is, despite the Naissankari not being stone workers, made predominately of stone ruins that have been retrofitted to be complete buildings. Pine needles are brushed together to serve as flooring for homes and even path ways between the the buildings in town. Roren gives off an ancient presence to any who visit it, and it's abuzz with some kind of magic, though Naissankari are too used to it to notice it. 

Wynne is a meritocracy, particularly in regards to strength. The current chieftain of Wynne may be challenged by anyone at any time, and they are required to accept the challenge. The chieftain must not only be the strongest fighter Wynne has, but the most clever, as well as the best hunter and most charismatic. Wynne has had very few incompetent leaders in it's past, though due to the benefits of experience most leadership in Wynne tends to be older people. This challenge is not to to the death, as anyone skilled enough to win once will always be of value to the community (those who have attempted cheating were banished on the spot, however). The Naissankari maintain their own pack leader who has the right to go against the Wynnite chieftain, but all pack leaders have historically been aligned with the Wynnite chieftain. 

Wynnite towns tend to be simple affairs with dirt roads and wooden buildings. Stone was mostly used for important buildings such as gathering halls and mausoleums, tho it has become more common for newer buildings; many buildings have added fire places of stone as renovations for the additional heat. Glass is uncommon, as there are no glass blowers on Wynne itself. Wood carved decorations are very popular and make use of left over wood from each log taken from the land. These decorations vary from door signs and posts all the way up to full size statues of animals.. Wynnite buildings are spaced fairly well, even in the most crowded parts of town. It's very hard to feel claustrophobic due to this but there was little in the way of city planning when the towns were constructed, making the streets hard to navigate. 

Wynne in the evenings is lit up mostly by torches mounted into walls and fireplaces, though both Coudell and Ceden have a large bonfire pit that's lit nightly near the center town. It's a popular place for people to spend time in the evenings, and makes use of waste produced throughout the day. Areas near the bonfire parks tend to have a permanent smokey smell to them, due to the constant fires. (The rest of Wynne tends to smell like evergreen forest, between shed needles from trees dragged to lumber yards, the dense forests, and seas breezes, the smell is a constant.)

Traditional Wynnite clothing is primarily furs and animal leathers, all taken from animals killed for food. Older worn down furs are trimmed and used for warmer weather apparel while newer furs are used when it's colder. Textiles from the mainland were quickly integrated into Wynne, one of the most popular things to come from the mainland. Furs are still used heavily, but wool clothing is far more comfortable indoors.

<!-- ## Interesting Things in Wynne

* No humans live in Roren, the ancestral home of the Naissankari. Some humans have been allowed to visit Roren, but there are places in Roren no human has ever seen. 
* Wynnites will not truly welcome a foreigner in their midsts until that outsider proves their worth to the community, that they are strong, capable, and get things done.

## Culture

Wynnite culture is rustic and simple. Every Wynnite is required to work hard and prove their worth in the community. Wynne has few farms due to the cold climate and the majority of job roles are related to food production. Fishing and hunting are some of the most common professions for Wynnites, as well as Gatherers who make full use of the land's offerings. Woodworking is another common profession in Wynne, and comes with the added responsibility to replace what you've taken. Wynne's respectful approach to how they take from nature is the reason they continue have resources to spare on the Gawic today. This applies to the other roles as well, Gatherer's are required to replant half of what they take from the forest and there are strict hunting limits. 

Hard work is rewarded in Wynne, though it does not guarantee increased rank (Competition between people at the same rank, such as two apprentices, is highly encouraged however). Asides from the Chieftain himself, no one is forcibly removed from their role by a upstart apprentice or skilled subordinate. Tradition dictates in cases where the apprentice or subordinate wants to achieve the leadership, it is time for him to set out and form his own shop. This is typically with the blessing of the former boss, and will an unspoken promise of fierce competition for business. By way of this, Wynne has many different shops for the same service. 

Most Wynnite jobs will only give workers one day off a week. The day is not consistent, and if work needs doing you're expected to show up even for the day off. There are few reasons Wynnites will accept for taking time off, most of which are life events such as weddings, pregnancies, and deaths. If someone is looking to break into a new skill set, explore a new area of the woods, or similar activity, that person is expected to get experience with that skill or prove their new area is safe on their own time before they bring it to anyone for credit. No one takes time off to 'learn' a skill, they take time off to find a job to use the skill they taught themselves on their own time. 

Wynnites can be stubborn in adapting to new concepts. The culture very much encourages 'it's not broken, don't fix it' and getting things done rather than 'wasting time' innovating. This is in part due to being a culture deeply rooted in tradition and following the ways of their ancestors and also in part to the leadership typically being older Wynnites. No Wynnite will investigate a shorter path through the woods if there's already one that gets them where they need to go, for example. If someone where to investigate on their own time and confirm a shorter route, it would take months before the majority of people would try that path. 

Wynne has no farms due to the cold climate and very few livestock animals, most of which are used for bi products such as milk. Wynnite's mostly eat fish and red meat, particular deer. They supplement this with anything that does grow in the cold, which is a variety of cold weather tolerant berries and nuts. As trade with the *Aeldun* continent became an option, more exotic food stuffs became a frequent import into Wynne. Jerky and the various hardy berries Gawic has are popular overseas. 

Children are expected to start helping the community by age 12. They are typically setup in an apprenticeship in a given trade which will last them until they're 16. At 16 children are considered adults and has the freedom to work in any field they so choose, but are expected to work as much as any other adult. 

Standardized education in Wynne is done in fairly small school houses, a handful to each settlement. Education lasts between 6 and 12 years of age for all children, and covers the basics one would expect to know. After 12 years of age, there is no formal education for Wynnites, only apprenticeships in trades. Wynne has no colleges of study, and most of their history is documented orally. Efforts are made to transcribe important events in Wynnite history, but these efforts tend to result in songs about powerful fighters or devastating events that can be expressed orally rather than written documents. 'It is the ancestors job to remember the past, and it is our job to live for them in the present. They will tell us of anything we need to know' is a common Wynne saying. 

Wynne is fond of oral tradition and song. Many lessons are taught through campfire tales and the tales describe Wynne's history as well. Chants are common as well, set to drum beats. 

Wynnite left magic behind when they originally immigrated to Gawic. It was a gift from Lylalel, who they chose not worship and therefore felt it had no relevance to them. The knowledge of it would be quickly forgotten and magic would not be reintroduced until it was seen in the Eraian Crusades. Even then, few Wynnites, martial people due to their harsh outdoors lives, took to magic. Those who did pursued the interest on Aeldun rather than study magic in Wynne itself. The national view of magic tends to be skeptical and considers it 'the long way around' when it comes to combat. 

Wolves are sacred animals in Wynnite culture. Killing a wolf is a crime akin to murder and if left up to Wynnite's you would be executed. However this crime in particular is always extradited to the Naissankari. No one who has committed the crime of killing a wolf has returned from the woods the Naissankari lead them to. (Naissankari will know that the crime for killing one of their own, laguz or not, is to be hunt through the woods and torn apart by all Naissankari kind.) Wynnites do not worship wolves however, nor the Naissankari. The sacred status for the wolf is a symbol of respect to their Naissankari brethren, and a power symbol of power and unity for the Wynne people.

Crime rates are low in Wynne, due to fairly severe punishments. There is no distinction between police and military in Wynne, and that means trained warriors are the people that will hunt you down be it theft or murder. Those warriors also have full discretion to use violence in your capture. It's considered a failure to not bring the criminal before the Chieftain, however. Banishment is a simple and easy punishment and is fairly common by the Chieftain, as well as forced labor in Wynne's sole mine. If the crime cannot be proven outright, there is a system in place for the criminal to duel with his accused, under the belief that the fighter with the stronger conviction about the truth of the crime. This system isn't perfect, as it's common the victim is a noncombatant while the criminal has combat skill. 

Gawic's mountains are home to a unique form of creature know as the pegasus. Shortly before the Eraian Crusades some Wynnites made an expressed effort to tame pegasus, with success. An outpost, *Aulcion* was built on the central mountain to serve as a roost for the tamed pegasi and a base for the newly formed pegasus knight unit. These knights are trained with bow and lance to make use of of their mounts agility and speed to support all aspects of a conflict. They do some search and rescue work as well. The knights remain small in number, as pegasi choose their own riders. Wynne is hoping to bred this trait out of the pegasi they've tamed already. As it stands, Naissankari cannot be become Pegasus Knights (the pegasi can smell the wolf on them) and pegasi seem to favor women, for some odd reason. 


## Military

⭕🔴

Unit             | Skill Level | Size
-----------------|-------------|-----
Infantry:        | 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 | Small
Cavalry:         | ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ | None
Magic Forces:    | ⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕ | None
Navy:            | 🔴🔴🔴⭕⭕ | Small
Pegasus Knights: | 🔴🔴🔴⭕⭕ | Small

Wynne's military force serves as an internal police force and also drives itself to improve. While Wynne's forces are by no means numerous, each is highly competitive with their fellows and pushes themselves to be stronger than every fighter they serves with. This attitude makes each Wynnite warrior an extremely talented and always evolving fighter. Wynne has a strong sense national pride which holds these competitive spirits together. Wynne's infantry is small in size, but extremely talented. Wynnite forces slightly favor melee combat to ranged, but only slightly. 

Wynne has no Cavalry or mage forces. Wynne has no horses native to them, and domesticating any animal that should be free goes against Wynnite culture's respect for nature. Wynne has little interest in magic, considering it a mainland thing, and therefore lacks enough dedicated mages to have any kind of unit of them.

Wynne's Navy is much like the infantry, small but skilled. The Navy sees more combat in peace time than the ground forces do, repelling pirates from fishing ships. Wynnite ships are small and fast, and crewed with the intention of boarding the enemy ship. Wynne has recently begun building slightly larger ships that have cannons on them, though none have been battle tested as of yet  <!-- TODO: Should 'recently begun' line be an entry in the timeline or part of a setting chapter?-->

Wynne has the unique asset of pegasus, native to Gawic, and have a small force of trained Pegasus Knights. Pegasus knights fly in wings of three, two wingmen to a flight lead. They operate wholly independent of other units on the battlefield, as communication is difficult. There are less than a dozen wings in the Pegasus Knights at the moment. 

Wynne's military tends to be light on leadership and high on individuality. Every warrior is expected to both hold their own and support their allies, and formations prevent them from doing that. There are general plans, and you're expected to go where your more experienced superiors tell you, but much of Wynnite combat is reactive and chaotic. Talent, power, and a sense of unity with one's fellows makes up for lack of tactics in Wynne. 

## Cities and Sites

* **Roren**: The ancestral home of the Wolf Laguz. There only a few months in year there isn't at least a few inches of snow on the ground. There's a single road that leads through the woods into the town. 
* **Coudell**: is the where the chieftain of Wynne currently resides. It has been the home of Wynnite culture since the begin, the original settlement. 
* **Cedan**: is the port city in Wynne. Ceden has three rivers running through the town that cross the peninsula the town is built on, leading to a large amount of bridges in town. The town is newer than Coudell and has some cobblestone streets, particularly around the dock built into the western bay. The largest building in Wynne is located in Cedan, a massive trade hall with a center bonfire and water access via a river.
* **Aulcion**: is located on the eastern border of the central mountains. Aulcion is a small village, nestled on a cliff. It's cold and very hard living, but is the home of those who breed and train with the pegasi native to those mountains. The populace are hardened pegasi breeders, their riders, and a militaristic staff keeping the village running.

## Foreign Relations

Wynne doesn't receive many visitors and Wynnites aren't used to seeing mainlanders. They're not hostile to newcomers but newcomers aren't truly welcome until they prove their worth somehow. Wynnites in general don't worry about international affairs much, content to their island home.

* **Callora**: Wynnites tend to see Etrinians as extravagant people who rely too much on others or people who need to stand up for themselves. Wynnites see far more of the former and find them exhausting to deal with. 

* **Dwyr**: Wynnites tend to see Dwyr people as stuck up and more focused on reading than doing. 

* **Torshan**: Wynnites tend to find people from Torshan as kindred spirits; Torshonian people are hard working and boisterous and Wynnite's people are hard working and somewhat wild. 

* **Eraia**: Wynne stood against Eraia with the Alliance in the Crusades, and still holds a grudge for the Honoril Alliance accepting peace terms with Eraia. Wynne does not trade with Eraia directly and still considers them a hostile force. Wynnites see Eraians as pushy followers who only do what the church tells them, people who don't care for individuality or the person themselves. 

* **Theanovene**: Wynne as a nation respected Theanovene for their decision to separate from the Alliance when it benefitted them to. However, Wynnites see Theanovians as cowards for not having a military and enforcing neutrality within their walls since that decision. 

<!-- TODO: Move to Drecian Invasion section? -->
<!-- * **Dreca**: Dreca, much like Eraia has an expansion policy that Wynne is against. Dreca's actions against the southern laguz also offend Wynne, as well as their overall treatment of the people and places they work through. Despite being a motivated and hard working force, Dreca is cruel and to Wynne it feels like what they could become if they slipped too far.  -->
