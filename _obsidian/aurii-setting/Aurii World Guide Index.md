# The World of Aurii

Aurii is a campaign world I ran a play by post game in for a number of years. The setting is fire emblem inspired: there are laguz (animal folk) races and no monsters and beasts that are staples in high fantasy. This very wiki takes it's name from the world, as I bought the domain name to host information about the world.

While a handful of timeframes in the world's history have been poked at and referenced, the primary one is the time of the Drecian Invasion. Dreca, the kingdom on the southern island, expands into the Kissaelain Territories (a fledgling laguz nation) and enslaves the residents. From there, they began a war with Eraia, a theocratic kingdom in the West, which is actively on going. Ferre is roped in by proxy as well, as Eraia conquered the island nation years prior and continues to occupy their ports, despite a rebellion brewing there.

The Honoril Alliance (made up for the kingdoms Dwyr, Callora, and Torshan) bickers over the best course of action with the two military powers in their world duking it out with only the neutral trade city Theanovene between them. Wynne, the hardened warrior nation far in the north, is eying the fight to know who to support.

## The World Guide

When the campaign first started, I provided a massive one page world guide with factoids about the various nations. It was hard to read and is now long out of date, so I started a project to create a "book" style world guide. While the campaign itself is long gone, I'd still like to finish this project at some point. This is your index to all the pages, complete or not, you'll find.
