# Scenario Basics

**Time Limits:** Time limits are typically measured in Rounds. A time limit that reads as "5 Rounds" lasts until the end of the 5th round. 

# Scenario Types

## Rout the Enemy

- *Map requirements:* None
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Rout `X%` of the Defender's Army.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Rout `Y%` of the Attacker's Army.

In a Rout the Enemy map, the only goal is to Rout a percentage of the enemy army. This can be 100%, or it can be a fraction like 80%. In most scenarios, the Attacker and Defender need to Rout the same percentage, but one side can need more than the other.

This Scenario can sometimes be "too simple" to play, as stall tactics like hiding a few units away from combat can drag out the match.

## Escape off Map

- *Map requirements:* A defined line or area of tiles as the "Escape" Area on the Defender's side of the map.
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* Optional: A max number of rounds before the Defender wins. 
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Get `X%` of units to the defined area on the map that lets them Escape.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Rout enough of the Attacker's army that they cannot meet Victory conditions or, if a max number of rounds was set, prevent Attacker from meeting Victory condition before max rounds is reached.

In a Escape off Map scenario, the Attacker must move through the map to a predesignated area where their units can "Escape" from the map. 

Any Attacker unit that ends it's turn in the Escape Area is removed from the map and counts towards the percentage of units the Attacker needs to win. An Escaped unit cannot re-enter the map once it has left. A Defender can place units on the Escape Area tiles. 

## Seize 

- *Map requirements:* A Gate, Throne, or other clearly defined single tile.
- *Army Requirements:* The Attacker must define one or more Leader unit for their Army.
- *Time Limit* A max number of rounds before the Defender wins.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Seize the designated tile with a Leader unit. 
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Rout all of the Attacker's Leader units or, if a max number of rounds was set, prevent Attacker from meeting Victory condition before max rounds is reached.

In a Seize scenario, an Attacker has a number of units (often one) that are designated as the Leader of their army. The Defender is defending a specific tile on the map from being seized by the Attacker. 

Seizing occurs when a Leader unit takes no Action and ends it's turn on the tile designated at the start of the scenario. This requires no roll and ends the battle immediately. A Defender is allowed to place units on the designated tile.

## Survive 

- *Map requirements:* None
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* A set number of rounds the Defender must survive.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Rout enough of the Attacker's army that they cannot meet Victory conditions.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Have `X%` of their Army survive unit the set number of rounds have passed.

In a Survive scenario, the Defender will win so long as `X%` of their army survives the set number of rounds defined at the start of the scenario. The Attacker must Rout enough of the Defender's army before the time limit is up. 

## Defend 

- *Map requirements:* A defined number of tiles on the Defender's side of the map designated as Key Areas.
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* A max number of rounds before the Defender wins.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Raze `X` of designated Key Areas before the max number of rounds is reached.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Prevent the Attacker from Razing `X` of the designated Key Area before the max number of rounds is reached. 

In a Defend scenario, the Defender is protecting villages or other locations on the map from Razing by the Attacker. The Defender must protect a minimum number of them for a set number of rounds in order to win.

An Attacker's unit can Raze a Key Area by ending their turn on a Key Area. Defending units can occupy Key Areas. 

## Objective Control

- *Map requirements:* Three tiles or tile areas on the map designated as Objectives. They should not be placed near each other.
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* A max number of rounds.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Control more of the Objectives at the end of the set number of rounds.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Control more of the Objectives at the end of the set number of rounds.

In an Objective Control scenario, both armies are trying to gain Control of set objectives on the map. A Unit gains control of the Objective by ending it's turn in or on the Objective. A Unit cannot can control over an Objective Area if an enemy unit is also in the Area. A Unit does not have to stay in or on the Objective to retain control of it. 

## Protect Unit

- *Map requirements:* A defined number of units designated as VIP units. (These units do not have to be in the Defender's Army.)
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* A max number of rounds before the Defender wins.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Rout `X` of designated VIP Units before the max number of rounds is reached.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Prevent the Attacker from eliminating `X` of the designated VIP units before the max number of rounds is reached. 

In a Protect scenario, the Defender is protecting predesignated VIP units from being Routed by the Attacker. These units may be units within the Attacker's army, or neutral units that do nothing each round. The Defender must protect a minimum number of them for a set number of rounds in order to win.

## Heist

- *Map requirements:* A defined line or area of tiles as the "Secure" Area on the Attacker's side of the map and a number of Treasure Chests on the map. 
- *Army Requirements:* None
- *Time Limit* A max number of rounds before the Defender wins.
- *Attacker Victory Conditions:* Steal from `X` of Treasure Chests and bring the stolen item to the defined Secure area on the map.
- *Defender Victory Conditions:* Prevent the Attacker from stealing `X` of the designated Treasure Chests before the max number of rounds is reached. 

In a Heist scenario, the Attacker is trying to reach designated Treasure Chests on the map that the Defender is protecting. A Treasure Chest can be opened using the **Pick** special action (Thieves, Rogues, and the Unlock Staff provide this) on it's tile. Once the item from the chest is acquired and placed in the Unit's Inventory, the Unit must bring the item to the designated Secure Area of the map at which point the item is removed from their Inventory and counted towards the Attacker's Victory Condition.
