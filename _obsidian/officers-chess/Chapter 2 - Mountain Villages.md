# Eastern Invasion (Defend)

> A crucial lesson in tactics is learning to work with and around terrain. Take for example these village nestled in the mountains. Perhaps it seems well defended, yet you can see near that the eastern village was already razed. The attack has already gained a foothold to continue their advance westward.
> How would you proceed?

In this Scenario, an attacking force is coming from the east with the goal of Razing the villages the Defender is protecting.

## Battle Preparations 

| Attacker's War Chest | Time Limit | Defender's War Chest |

- *Deployment Zones:* The Attacker may deploy their units anywhere northeast of the eastern most fort on the map. The Defender may deploy north of the southern village, past the mountains, and west of the northwest village.

- *Victory Conditions:* The Attacker wins if all three Villages are Razed.

# Dangerous Pass (Escape Off Map)

> Terrain can create natural chokepoints you must be aware of. An army passing through this area in enemy territory is in for trouble, as their opponent has a clear bottleneck into the path. 
> How would you proceed?
