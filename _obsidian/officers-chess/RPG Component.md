# Character Creation

Unlike most TTRPGs, you'll be playing not only your main character but secondary characters that you share with one of the other players at the table. These secondary characters are typically retainers or followers of your main character, and will be shared between you and the player who will play them in roleplay encounters. 

To begin, each player should go around and give a brief description of their main character. Unit sheets aren't important here, simply backstory and who this character is. These are referred to as the "Lord" characters.

After all the main characters are introduced, you will need to work with each other other players to create a character the follows your main character. You may have ideas of your own, or work together to create them. The same level of detail applies to the "Retainers" as Lords.

> EX: Alice has created a Lord named Chrom, a royal who prefers to spend his time helping the common folk with bandits to being in the palace. 
> 
> She turns to Beth and asks what Beth thinks of playing Chrom's younger sister. Beth likes the idea and adds that Lissa (the character) could be an axe fighter who only looks less powerful than Chrom. The two agree and Lissa becomes Chrom's first Retainer.
> 
> Alice then asks Bob what kind of retainer he had in mind for Chrom. Bob thinks about it and says he'd like to play a knight in service to Chrom, whose extremely by the book compared to Chrom who doesn't stay on top of his royal responsibilities. Alice likes this idea and they decide this character will be Frederick.
> 
> Next, Beth works with Alice and Bob to create her Lord's Retainers, and Bob works with Alice and Beth to create his. 

*You can see the status of character creation after Alice's retainers have been made in the below image. Characters in the blue box for each player (Alice, Bob, and Beth) are controlled by that player.*

## Character Sheets

Now that you've defined your Lord and Retainer characters, you can give them character sheets. 

1. Start by assigning them a [Class]({% link _obsidian/officers-chess/v0.9 Classes.md %}). Depending on the game you may be required to choose an unpromoted class to start. These classes will grow into the promoted one via progression. *On Foundry there is a compendium with all the Class values setup for you.*
2. Choose one of your stats and increase it by one Rating. Choose a different Rating and reduce it by one. (This can boost A to S and drop E to F.)
4. Chose a [Weapon]({% link _obsidian/officers-chess/v0.9 Weapons.md %}) that meets your weapon proficiencies. You then may choose a second weapon, or take a Vulnerary (a healing item with 3 uses.)
5. Give your character a name and description.

## Advancement

AP is earned in combat: each combat a unit battles in earns it one AP. It doesn't matter if the enemy was defeated, only that the Unit survived. 

- AP Advancement points
    - Exchange for Gold for weapon upgrades
    - Forge levels (or those are Gold)
    - Skill purchase
    - Second Sealing (Master Seal is a required item)

# Mechanical Changes

## Character Death

In the core game, a unit dies when it reaches 0 HP in a battle. As characters mean a bit more in a roleplaying scenario, you may wish to adjust the rules for death as follows.

When a unit reaches 0 HP, the unit is considered to be grievously wounded. The unit can no longer move, fight, or take any other actions. Any attacks made against the unit are automatic hits. The amount of damage is not important in this state, any three attacks against the unit will cause them to die for real. 

Allied units may carry a wounded ally up to half their move (rounded down). If a wounded unit is carried this way, the allied unit may not take another action. for their turn.
