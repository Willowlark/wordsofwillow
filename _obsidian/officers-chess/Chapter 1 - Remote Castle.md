# Storm the Castle (Seize)

> You're leading an attacking force to Rout an enemy of the Church who has holed up inside of their castle. Their forces have control of the surrounding area and the castle gate. You'll need to take control of the gate in order to get to your target.
> How would you proceed?

The Attacking army must Seize the tile with the castle gate in it using the a Unit they designate as the Leader of their army. Any Unit the Attacker brings into the battle can be designated as Leader. This must be done before Deployment.

## Battle Preparations 

| Attacker's War Chest | Time Limit | Defender's War Chest |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 500 Gold             | Optional   | 700 Gold             | 

- *Deployment Zones:* The Attacker's Deployment Zone is the patch of yellow plains tiles to the south of the eastern most village. The Defender's Deployment Zone is anywhere west of the the western village. The Defender deploys first. 
- *Victory Conditions:* The Attacker must Seize the castle gate tile. The Defender must Rout the enemy's Leader. Both must do so before the Time Limit expires if a Time Limit has been set. The battle ends immediately when the Attacker Seizes the gate.
- Attacker chooses a Unit to give the **Leader** tag.

## Payouts

- For every unit Routed by the Defender or Attacker, that player earns **the Unit Cost of that Unit**.
    - The Defender earns **twice** the usual payout for eliminating the **Attacker's Leader**. (the default Routed payout does not apply.)
- The Attacker earns **250 Gold** when their **Leader Seizes** the castle gate. 

# Too Much Peril (Escape off Map)

> Sometimes, fleeing is a better tactical option than making a last stand in a fortified position. Take for example this scenario, where your forces hold a castle ruin but must escape before a superior force Routs them. 
> How would you proceed?

The Defender begins at the castle in the west. They must have all of their Units escape to the south of the map before the Attacker's force over takes them.

## Battle Preparations 

| Attacker's War Chest | Time Limit | Defender's War Chest |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 500 Gold             | None       | 500 Gold             |

- *Deployment Zones:* The Defender deploys their units within two tiles of the castle's gate. The Attacker deploys anywhere to the east of the forts in the center of the map. The Defender deploys first.

- The Defender must hire at least 4 Units to their army. 
- All Defender units have the **Fleeing** tag. They may Escape on any of the southern most tiles west of the southern mountains.

- For every Unit the Defender Routs, they earn **that Unit's Cost**.
