# Welcome

This here is the homepage of my projects blog. I work heavily out of the application Obsidian (effectively an offline wiki) for my creative projects and in order to have a way to publish my documents, I wrote a pipeline to send my projects from Obsidian here. Most of what you'll see here is exports, so if there's any goofy formatting, contact me and I'll see about fixing it.

## What's Aurii Stand For?

Aurii was an old custom campaign setting I used to run a Play by Post for. I hosted various documents on a static website for it and ended up getting the domain name, which I'm now repurposing here.

## What am I running right now?

- A Fabula Ultima campaign set in a world run by the megacorporation Millennium and their founder, Eon Dusk. Millennium's invention of Magic anyone can use has dark secrets though, so while to the public he's a savior, to a select few Dusk is a monster destroying the world one General Purpose Tome at a time.
- A Fabula Ultima campaign inspired by Expedition 33, using the prologue as a basis but with a completely different continent to trek across to defeat the Paintress
